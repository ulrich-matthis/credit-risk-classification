# credit-risk-classification

For this weeks assignment we were provided financial data pretaining to loan status and asked to interpret that data using supervised machine learning techniques specifically Logistic Regression Modeling. Our data was tested twice once using the standard data and a second time following resampling the training data. Confusion matrixes were also created following both model tests and these analyses are provided within the code and the Analysis Markdown file.
